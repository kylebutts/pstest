#' pstest: An R Package for Assessing the Goodness-of-fit of Propensity Score Models.
#'
#'An R package for implementing all the tests proposed in Sant'Anna and
#'Song (2016), 'Specification Tests for the Propensity Score', available at
#'Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna webpage, \url{http://sites.google.com/site/pedrohcsantanna/} .
#'
#'In short, this package implements bootstrapped based Kolmogorov-Smirnov
#'and Cramer-von Mises type tests for parametric propensity score models with
#'either logistic ('logit'), or standard normal ('probit') link function.
#'
#' The module was written by Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna (Vanderbilt University) and Xiaojun Song (Peking University).
#'
#' A help file with examples will be made available in the near future.
