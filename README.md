# pstest: An R Package to Assess the Goodness-of-Fit of Parametric Propensity Score Models.


This R package implements the specification tests proposed in Sant'Anna and
Song (2016), 'Specification Tests for the Propensity Score', available at
Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna webpage, http://sites.google.com/site/pedrohcsantanna/ .


In short, this package implement bootstrapped based Kolmogorov-Smirnov
and Cramer-von Mises type tests for parametric propensity score models with
either logistic ('logit'), or standard normal ('probit') link function.


The module was written by Pedro H.C. Sant'Anna (Vanderbilt University) and Xiaojun Song (Peking University).


A help file with examples will be made available in the near future.
